= Spring Session - Cassandra Repositories

This guide describes how to use Spring Session backed by Cassandra inside a Spring Boot application.

NOTE: The completed guide can be found in the <<cassandra, Cassandra sample application>>.

== Dependency Requirements
In order to work with this implementation, only the following artifact is required for your dependency management
system of choice:

[source]
org.springframework.data:spring-data-cassandra

[[cassandra-spring-configuration]]
== Spring Configuration
The Spring configuration is responsible for creating a Servlet Filter that replaces the `HttpSession` implementation
with an implementation backed by Spring Session.

// tag::config[]
All you have to do is to add the following Spring Configuration:

[source,java]
----
include::{samples-dir}cassandra/src/main/java/sample/config/HttpSessionConfig.java[tags=class]
----

<1> The `@EnableCassandraHttpSession` annotation creates a Spring Bean with the name of `springSessionRepositoryFilter`
that implements Filter. The filter is what is in charge of replacing the `HttpSession` implementation to be backed by
Spring Session, which is in turn backed by Cassandra.
// end::config[]

[[boot-cassandra-configuration]]
== Configuring Cassandra

When a Cassandra cluster is available, the primary configuration properties are available via
`@EnableCassandraHttpSession`

=== Application context provided dependencies.

In order to enable Spring session's session management capabilities using Cassandra it is mandatory for your application
to configure and auto-wire a bean of the type `com.datastax.driver.core.Session` which must define a cluster contact
point host, as well as a port number. When injected, this bean will be used in conjunction with
`org.springframework.cassandra.core.CqlOperations` to issue queries against the Cassandra cluster.

=== `tableName`
The name of cassandra table used by Spring Session to store sessions. Defaults to `spring_session`.

In a similar fashion to the JDBC implementation, this implementation requires you to pre-initialize the tables to be
be used to persist session data across the cluster. Typically, you'd want to use an initialization CQL script, or a
schema migration tool such as `cassandra-migration-tool-java`
https://github.com/smartcat-labs/cassandra-migration-tool-java

Once a schema is initialized, this implementation will also attempt to access a secondary table, with the `_by_name`
suffix. For example, using the default primary table name, a secondary table will be accessed by the following name:

`spring_session_by_name`

=== `maxInactiveIntervalInSeconds`
The session timeout in seconds. Defaults to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

=== `consistencyLevel`
The consistency level that will be used for all Spring session management queries. Defaults to `ConsistencyLevel.ONE`.
Depending on your application's performance requirements, it might be necessary to customize this value.

For more information, refer to http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-nosql.html#boot-features-cassandra[Connecting to Cassandra]
portion of the Spring Boot documentation.

[[cassandra-sample]]
== Cassandra Sample Application

The Cassandra Sample Application demonstrates how to use Spring Session to transparently leverage Cassandra to back a
web application's `HttpSession` when using Spring Boot.

[[cassandra-running]]
=== Running the Cassandra Sample Application

You can run the sample by obtaining the {download-url}[source code] and invoking the following command:

----
$ ./gradlew :samples:cassandra:bootRun
----

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:8080/

To login, use the following credentials:

* **Username** _user_
* **Password** _password_

Once logged in, The user's information is stored in Cassandra rather than Tomcat's `HttpSession` implementation.

When a new `HttpSession` is created, Spring Session creates a cookie named SESSION in your browser that contains the id
of the client's session.

To verify this, you may inspect the browser's cookies with
https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/resources#cookies[Chrome] or
https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Cookies_Panel#Cookies_List[Firefox].
